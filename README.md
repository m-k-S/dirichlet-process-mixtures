# Practical Dirichlet Process Mixture Modeling

This is the repository for my final project for the course Machine Learning with Probabilistic Programming, taught by Professor Alp Kucukelbir in Fall 2019. The full writeup of the project is located at `/final-project/final-notebook.ipynb` and all other auxiliary files are located in the same directory. Please note that the cells of the notebook are meant to run sequentially and functionality will likely break if they are run out of order.
